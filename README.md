## Sources
Drawings made by people are taken from the [Google Quick, Draw! dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).

Drawings made by the AI are generated by a GAN model made and trained by me. More information on the model can be found at [Quick Draw GAN](https://github.com/AlexanderMertens/quick_draw_gan).
